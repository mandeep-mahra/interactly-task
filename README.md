# ReactFlow Graph Editor

This project is a simple web application developed using ReactJS and Redux, utilizing the reactflow.dev library to create a graph editor. The application allows users to create, update, and delete nodes and branches within a graph.

## Features

- Create nodes in circle/rectangle shapes on the graph panel.
- Connect two nodes with a branch.
- Delete nodes and branches by clicking on an 'X' icon upon mouseover.
- Open a popup window to give a title to each node.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Redux
- reactflow.dev library

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you will be directed to the 'Home' page.
2. On the left side of the page, you'll find a button labeled 'Create node'. Clicking this button will create a new node on the graph panel.
3. To connect two nodes with a branch, click and drag from one node to another.
4. Hovering over a node or branch will display an 'X' icon in red color. Clicking this icon will delete the respective node or branch.
5. Clicking on a node will open a popup window on the right side, allowing you to give a title to the node. Once saved, the title will appear on top of the node.
